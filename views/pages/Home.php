    <h2>Welcome to my CRUD website</h2>
    <span class="span">This website was made by me @tyfvf, and posted on my github, just for fun, as a parody for NFTs. In this website you can make your account, login in, see your profile and add how many IMGs you want in your collection. The market, to add IMGs, is controlled by the admins, who create new IMG, update them or if it pleases them, delete them!</span>
